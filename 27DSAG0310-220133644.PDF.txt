How can rising population of India be turned into an asset?

The ever-growing statistics of India’s Population has been grave cause for the country. India is the second most populous country in the world in the world after China, and it is predicted that India will become most populous country in the world in near future. For this much population we have to take side of positive terms by utilizing them in productive activities. If we think of ways then we have more positive effects rather than negative ones. Before getting ahead with this I would like you to remember key facts and background.

Key Facts and Backgrounds
1.In next 50 years, growth Population of India shot up 3 times.
2.There has not been any increasing in the land size of India.
3.Growing population ate up the entire economic growth of India and the country could register its very slow progress.
4.Present skilled workforce in India is only 2%.

Then How?
•	The youth segment of India’s population is growing rapidly, and is projected to continue to do so for the next 30 years. This demographic dividend has the potential to inject new dynamism into country’s flagging economy if the state acts quickly on health, education and employment.
•	Right now, more than 50% of India’s population is below 25 which can be tapped for all round socio-economic growth of the nation as the young workforce has more innovative minds.
•	Except China no country in the world has such a big man power as India has which is indeed a blessing for the country. Such a huge and skilled man power coupled with resources needs to be regarded as an asset.
•	The huge population offers a bigger pool of human resource and hence a bigger consumer market.
•	In the past decade, India has emerged as a major back office to the world with global firms outsourcing work to take advantage of the country's less expensive, educated, young English-speaking workforce.
•	India produces 2.5 million IT, engineering and life sciences graduates a year, besides about 650,000 post graduates in science and IT related subjects. The IT sector alone employs about 850,000 graduates and professionals while the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors are snapping up others.
•	We cannot talk about turning the rising population into an asset without taking into account the problems of corruption, poverty and illiteracy which go hand in hand and have been creating hurdle in the country’s progress as a whole.
•	There is a need for the implementation of the government schemes like National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme in the rural areas at a massive scale so that more and more people are able to join the national mainstream.
•	There is a need to make the rural population of the country more and more literate and bring them out of poverty. The schools in the villages need to be made more developed with the curriculum and education system matching with that of the schools in the cities.
•	The public schemes targeting the poor need to be implemented properly and honestly because after that it would be easy to bring the large chunk of the country’s population into national mainstream so that they are able to play a decisive role in nation building.
•	India needs various job schemes in the interior regions where there is not much industrial activity.
•	No capital in the world can substitute the human capital, the Indian state and the government need to properly utilize its skilled and talented population.
